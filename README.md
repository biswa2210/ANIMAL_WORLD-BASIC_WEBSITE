## About :point_down: 

     
**I have made this project but just for group project purpose my class mates' as well as group members' names are written in developers area.** Odisha Odia: , formerly Orissa, is an Indian state located in Eastern India. It is the 8th largest state by area, and the 11th largest by population. The state has the third largest population of Scheduled Tribes in India. It neighbours the states of West Bengal and Jharkhand to the north, Chhattisgarh to the west, and Andhra Pradesh to the south. Odisha has a coastline of 485 kilometres (301 mi) along the Bay of Bengal. The region is also known as Utkala and is mentioned in India's national anthem, "Jana Gana Mana". The language of Odisha is Odia, which is one of the Classical Languages of India.
The ancient kingdom of Kalinga, which was invaded by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka (which was again won back from them by king Kharavela) in 261 BCE resulting in the Kalinga War, coincides with the borders of modern-day Odisha. The modern boundaries of Odisha were demarcated by the British Indian government when Orissa Province was established on 1 April 1936, consisting of the Odia-speaking districts of Bihar and Orissa Province. The first of April is celebrated as Utkala Dibasa. Cuttack was made the capital of the region by Anantavarman Chodaganga in c. 1135, after which the city was used as the capital by many rulers, through the British era until 1948. Thereafter, Bhubaneswar became the capital of Odisha.<br>
This is a website created by HTML only. Here are total five parts and introduction part. First is Religious Festival. Here we can know about Ratha Yatra. The second part, Social Festival contains description about Makar Sankranti. In the third part, Regional Festival part, we can find Vasanta Panchami, Dhanu Jatra, Gajalaxmi Puja, Raja Parba. In the fourth part, we can learn about Nabanna ,Lok Uthsav of Odisha. In the last part ,Developers Introduction, contains six names but the project is only developed by Biswarup Bhattacharjee. The other names are included just for project submission for HS exam. In this website we can easily learn about Odisha's festivals instead of searching them in other fields. The designs and divisions are made to make it user friendly.

## Purpose :point_down:

Every part of our beloved India will wish you with high spirits of festivity. The vibrant culture, rich customs, feeling of celebration, a plate full of exquisite meal. After all, this what India- the festival of land is known for. One such part of India where festivals run the happy lives of people is Orrisa. Being a land of various religions and tribe, you will find numerous festivals being celebrated by the people throughout the year.

## Importance :point_down:

<div align="justified">
     
Festivals are a big part of Indian culture and tradition. The same is the case with Odisha. While many people often tend to think that Odisha is only about Rathyatra, the state does celebrate a lot more than just that. It is best if you know what they are and what kind of things are done during those festivals if you do want a one of a kind experience. You must ensure the kind of significance they have and the kind of influence they have on the culture and traditions of the people involved. To help you gain a better understanding and knowledge of the festivals in Odisha, I have made this website. To know about Orisha's culture, festivals it is important and user friendly.
